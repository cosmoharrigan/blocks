class Checkpoint(SimpleExtension):
    """Saves a pickled version of the main loop to the disk.

    The pickled main loop can be later reloaded and training can be
    resumed.

    Makes a `SAVED_TO` record in the log with the serialization destination
    in the case of success and ``None`` in the case of failure. The
    value of the record is a tuple of paths to which saving was done
    (there can be more than one if the user added a condition
    with an argument, see :meth:`do` docs).

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The destination path for pickling.
    save_separately : list of str, optional
        The list of the main loop's attributes to be pickled separately
        to their own files. The paths will be formed by adding
        the attribute name preceded by an underscore before the
        `path` extension. The whole main loop will still be pickled
        as usual.

    Notes
    -----
    Using pickling for saving the whole main loop object comes with
    certain limitations:

    * Theano computation graphs build in the GPU-mode
      (`theano.config.device == "gpu"`) can not be used in the usual mode
      (and vice-versa). Therefore using this extension binds you to using
      only one kind of device.
